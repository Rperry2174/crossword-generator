# Crossword Validation Improvements

**User prompt:**

this is close, but we need an extra rule . this is not valid because "R" from "Cross" being above "n" from "python" and "RN" is not one of the words that we provided. additionally "Word" and "Grid" are nto connected to the rest of the puzzle in anyway they're just sort of floating. I think just to give an allowance let's say that a valid crossword can have one word not in the puzzle i.e. "rn" for every 5 words. Later we will find a way to make clues that adapt to the words rather than words that adapt to the clues

## Key Issues Identified:

1. **Invalid perpendicular words**: When placing words that intersect, new unintended words are formed (like "RN") that aren't in the original word list
2. **Disconnected words**: Some words ("WORD", "GRID") float independently without connecting to the main crossword structure
3. **Invalid crossword structure**: Real crosswords must be fully connected networks

## Proposed Rules:

1. **Perpendicular word validation**: Check all words formed perpendicular to placed words and ensure they are either:
   - In the original word list, OR
   - Allow up to 1 unintended word per 5 intended words (flexible allowance)

2. **Connectivity requirement**: All placed words must connect to the existing crossword structure (no floating isolated words)

3. **Future consideration**: Plan for adaptive clue generation that works with valid word formations rather than forcing words to fit predetermined clues

## Implementation Changes Made:

- Added `_extract_perpendicular_words()` method to detect words formed perpendicular to placements
- Added `_is_valid_perpendicular_placement()` to validate perpendicular word formations  
- Added `_is_connected_to_existing()` to ensure all words connect to existing structure
- Removed random fallback placement to prevent disconnected words
- Added `max_unintended_words` rule (1 per 5 intended words)
- Enhanced `can_place_word()` to include connectivity and perpendicular validation
