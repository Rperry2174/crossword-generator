# Dynamic Word Input and Backend Integration

**User prompt:**

Now let's iterate one step further.. The idea is that eventually I would like to have an llm come up with a list of clues and answers to those clues and dynamically generate the crossword based off of that list of words... So for now, let's add a input box to the frontend where I can provide a list of words separated by a comma and then the backend will create a crossword, validate it and proved all the infromation back to the frontned for bot hthe accross list, the down list, and the crossword makeup and structure itself . Save this prompt and accomplish this

## Project Vision:

**Ultimate Goal**: LLM-generated crosswords where an AI creates both clues and answers, then dynamically generates a valid crossword puzzle.

**Current Step**: Bridge frontend and backend by allowing user input of word lists that get processed into valid crosswords.

## Requirements Specified:

### **Frontend Changes:**
1. **Input interface**: Add text input box for comma-separated word lists
2. **User workflow**: 
   - User enters words like "PYTHON,CODE,TEST,GRID,WORD"
   - Submits to backend for processing
   - Receives complete crossword data back
3. **Dynamic display**: Replace stub data with real backend-generated crosswords

### **Backend Integration:**
1. **API endpoint**: Create endpoint to accept word lists and return crossword data
2. **Crossword generation**: Use existing robust algorithm to generate valid puzzles
3. **Data structure**: Return all necessary information:
   - Grid structure (15x15 with letters/nulls)
   - Word placements with positions and directions
   - Across clue list with numbers and words
   - Down clue list with numbers and words

### **Communication Flow:**
```
Frontend Input → Backend Processing → Validated Crossword → Frontend Display
    ↓                    ↓                     ↓                    ↓
User types words    Algorithm runs      Returns grid data    Interactive puzzle
```

### **Future Readiness:**
- Structure should easily accommodate LLM-generated word lists
- Clue system should be ready for actual questions (not just words)
- Scalable for more complex crossword generation requirements

## Implementation Plan:

### **Backend API:**
1. Create FastAPI or Flask endpoint `/generate-crossword`
2. Accept POST request with word list
3. Process through existing CrosswordGenerator
4. Return JSON with complete crossword data

### **Frontend Integration:**
1. Add word input form component
2. Implement API call functionality
3. Update state management for dynamic crosswords
4. Replace stub data with real backend responses

### **Data Flow Enhancement:**
- Maintain existing interactive typing functionality
- Add loading states for backend processing
- Error handling for invalid word combinations
- Success feedback for generated puzzles

This step creates the foundation for future LLM integration while providing immediate functionality for custom word list crosswords.
